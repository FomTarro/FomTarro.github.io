                                    Heist Night is a local multiplayer game of cops-and-robbers, with a turnbased stealth twist. Four players play as the team of thieves, while the fifth plays as the entire police force.<br>
                                    Players gather around the television and connect in using their mobile device as a controller, providing them each with a private screen, and allowing each player to sneak around without fear of screen-cheating!<br>
                                    No external app is necessary to play, so anyone on any device can join the fun!<br><br>

                                    Winner of the MassDiGI Game Challenge "Best College Alpha" Award in 2016, Heist Night was also chosen to be showcased at the 2016 Boston Festival of Indie Games.<br><br>

                                    Much of the hard work I've put in to Heist Night are in its backend systems. Namely, the game pushes Unity to the limit of what it was meant to do by generating a local content server in-app at runtime, without the need for external software. It also features two-way netcode communications with our non-Unity, custom-designed HTML mobile controllers, which are served to players via the aforementioned server. Heist Night is an ongoing labor of love that gets better by the day.<br><br>

                                    Designed and built in (under) 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2016 following the theme: <i>'Ritual!'</i><br><br>

                                    Summon Me Something is a two-player competitive game wherein players must conjure up potions using three ingredients from a set of many to create something that meets the description set forth by the teacher.<br> 
                                    There's just one catch: you don't know what any of the ingredients correspond to, and you might never! The ingredients change purpose every match, meaning that each game is a new association puzzle to figure out faster than your opponent. The first player to ten correct solutions wins the match.<br><br> 

                                    Can be played with two controllers, or with two players at a single keyboard!<br>

                                    Developed over 7 weeks as the project with a nine-person, randomly-assigned team for CS3733: Software Engineering, the WPI Mapper is an open-ended application capable of plotting efficient and accessible routes around campus. By storing and reading map data to and from a remote database, the application was capable of being used from any terminal with minimal overhead.<br><br>

                                    In addition to providing a detailed map of the WPI campus, the Mapper also allowed for any calculated route plans to be sent to email with accompanying step-by-step images. Furthermore, the route calculation can be tweaked by the user by altering Route Settings, where the user can inform the program if they require special accommodations, such as wheelchair accessibility.<br><br>

                                    During my time on the team, I served as overall project manager and focused on engineering effective developer-end tools. These developer tools to allow any location to be imported and edited, such that the application could be used for more locations than just the campus map. These tools also utilized our server storage for multi-touch editing capabilities, allowing multiple team members to work on filling out the map simultaneously.<br><br>

                                    Of course, with the term being long over, the server hosting the map data has since been taken offline.<br>

                                    Fantastic Finale starts you off at the very end of your quest against the Dark Lord Dramatos. With the world again at peace, what else is there left for an overleveled warrior to do? <br><br>

                                    Somewhat overscoped, we wanted to try something new to us for this Game Jam. With a visual style inspired by Paper Mario, we wanted to create a small narrative experience. For me, this meant designing a dialog and cutscene system from scratch over the weekend. These systems would later get recycled and improved for 'Summon Me Something'.<br><br>

                                    Created as part of my Interactive Qualifying Project, which I enrolled in a year early as a sophomore at the behest of my partners Dillon DeSimone and Francesca Carletto-Leon. Project Overworld was a GPS-enabled mobile app that aimed to make the navigation of campus more accessible to new freshmen by featuring a host of information about each unique location as they are visited, by providing directions to and from any two locations on campus, and by providing hotlines to campus utilities and local restaurants.<br><br>

                                    Project Overworld was also planned to feature avatar customization and a trivia system which would ask questions about campus facilities and historical lore.<br>
                                    Unfortunately, as my second real game project, Overworld suffered from being overscoped, and as such, these trivia features never came in to fruition. Other scrapped ideas included an asynchronous multiplayer system, akin to the StreetPass functionality present in the Nintendo 3DS.<br><br>

                                    After spending all too much time debating the semantics of the theme, we opted to take a literal but mistranscribed stab at it.<br>
                                    In Wee Sea Things, the player controls a tiny Sea Monkey in an aquarium as well as a child holding a magnifying glass to look in to the tank. By magnifying the Sea Monkey, they take on properties as though they were actually physically larger; they can jump higher and fall faster through the water.<br><br>

                                    Wee Sea Things was my first Unity Project, and I was rather proud of it at the time. It features some fancy viewport trickery to achieve the magnification visual effect, and overall I think it represents a somewhat novel and unique concept.<br><br>

                                An ongoing Capstone project for Robotics Engineering, the Interactive Segway Robot is being designed to provide automated registration for walk-in Emergency Room patients and/or hospital visitors.<br><br>

                                By presenting individuals with an intuitive, calming and accessible user interface on an onboard touchscreen, the robot can quickly collect important intake data about the individual.<br>From there, it interfaces with the hospital database to automatically assign patient a room, escort them there, and alert a doctor to tend to them.<br><br>

                                The drive base is being programmed using ROS and Python on Debian. The touchscreen UI is being developed using HTML5, connecting to ROS and external interfaces via Websocket.<br><br>

                                This robot is being produced with help from my teammates, Jacob Hackett, Erin Leger, Emily Yu and Joe Fainer.<br>

                                Programmed over 7 weeks using ROS and Python on Ubuntu, we designed a system for the Turtlebot to facilitate autonomous navigation around a procedurally explored map.<br><br> 

                                Using visual data from its onboard Kinect sensor, the Turtlebot parsed the data into a working map. From there, it used A* to plan efficient routes towards unexplored regions of the map, in order to optimally continue exploration until the entire pathable area was discovered and parsed.<br><br>

                                This robot was produced with help from my teammates, Jacob Hackett and Lumbini Parnas.<br>
                                Included below is a screenshot of the live map visualization produced by the robot.

                                Working from a prefabricated embedded board and 3D-printed 2-DOF arm, we programmed and tested a system that allowed the arm to function as a sorting tool for objects on an assembly line in just 7 weeks.<br><br>

                                To facilitate this task, the team updated a code library in C that was given to us in a work-in-progress state. This library was source-controlled using GitHub and sported such expanded features and PID control and Analog-to-Digital I/O conversion.<br><br>

                                Using an IR sensor, the arm was capable of determining the speed of the block as it moved down the conveyor belt, determining where along the width of the belt the block was. By taking these factors in to account in combination with Inverse Kinematics programming, the arm reaches for and picks up the moving object as it passes by. From here, the arm weighs the object, and uses that information to determine how it should tilt the integrated hopper before dropping the object on to the hopper itself. <br><br>

                                Designed, fabricated and tested over the course of 7 weeks, this robot (nicknamed Marlow, after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlow_Briggs_and_the_Mask_of_Death" style="color: #C3C3C3;" target="_blank">something really dumb</a>) was capable of autonomously navigating randomized mazes to locate and extinguish a fire located within the maze itself.<br><br>

                                Marlow was also capable of keeping and reporting accurate data regarding its own position and the estimated position of the fire back to its owner. Using a combination of prefabricated sensors and custom-fabricated parts, Marlow can be constructed on a budget of under $400.<br><br>
