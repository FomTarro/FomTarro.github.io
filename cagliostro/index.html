            <h1>The Castle of Cagliostro</h1>
            <p>
                The Castle of Cagliostro (Japanese: ルパン三世 カリオストロの城 Hepburn: Rupan Sansei: Kariosutoro no Shiro, Lupin the Third: Castle of Cagliostro) is a 1979 Japanese animated adventure comedy film co-written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki in his feature-length directorial debut. It is the second film featuring Monkey Punch's master thief Arsène Lupin III, from his manga series Lupin III. The film was Miyazaki's first time directing a theatrical feature after having previously worked as an animator for Toei Animation and TMS Entertainment and directing several shows including Lupin III and two episodes of Lupin III Part II.

            <p>
                In the twilight of his career, Lupin III's latest and greatest caper has hit a snag. What should've been bags of cash from a national casino turns out to be expert counterfeits! Together with his partner-in-crime Jigen, Lupin heads to the remote European nation of Cagliostro to exact revenge. Not everything goes as planned; the two encounter Clarisse, a royal damsel in distress being forced to marry the sinister Count Cagliostro against her will. Saving her won't be easy, however, as Lupin and Jigen -- together with Lupin's unpredictable ex-girlfriend Fujiko and the swordsman Goemon -- must fight their way through a trap-filled castle, a deadly dungeon, and an army of professional assassins! Can Lupin rescue the girl, evade the cuffs of his long-time nemesis Inspector Zenigata, and uncover the secret treasures of The Castle of Cagliostro?

            <h1>Releases</h1>
            <p>
                The film's Japanese theatrical release was on 15 December 1979, and began screen testing in North America in the following year. Unfortunately, many of these screenings were not well-attended, as many Americans expected the film to be a light-hearted children's story, much like pevious animated works from Disney. As such, few bothered to make the trip to go see it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1991, the film made its theatrical debut in America, featuring an English voice dub by Streamline pictures. This dub features a couple of localization changes (most notably, Lupin III is renamed 'The Wolf'), and gruffs up the dialogue a bit more to make the gang seem more hard-boiled. This version of the film saw home release the following year.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2000, the film was dubbed in English for a second time, this time by Manga Video. This version followed the original Japanese script more closely, and corrected the localization changes made in the previous dub.
